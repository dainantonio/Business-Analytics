# Project description
A large part of working with data is being able to interpret data visualizations and explain your insights to others. 
To give you some practice with this, weâ€™ve selected a few Tableau dashboards for you to explore.
The links are below, under "Choose from these Dashboards." Choose one of these dashboards, whichever one interests 
you the most, and find three insights in the visualizations. For each insight, provide a static image that shares what you found. Write a short report 
explaining each observation and how you found the information to reach your conclusion from the dashboard. Altogether (including images), your report should be 1-2 pages.

## Choose from these dashboards
