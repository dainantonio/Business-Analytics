# Project 1 - Interpret a Data Visualization

This project will allow you to draw insights from interactive dashboards.
A large part of working with data is being able to interpret data visualizations and explain your insights to others. This project will build your intuition on working with data dashboards, while also showing you the types of beautiful visualizations you will be able to produce by the end of this program!


# Project 2 - Analyze NYSE Data

In this project, you will work with a New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
dataset that contains fundamental financial data for 500 companies.
You will use spreadsheets to analyze and summarize the data using
statistics and data visualizations. You will communicate the key
findings in a professional manner. You will also design a dashboard
that calculates the financial metrics and auto populates the income
statement for each company using data validation and advanced
lookup tools within Excel. You will then forecast financial metrics
within the Income Statement, based on three scenarios with distinct
assumptions for a company of your choice from the NYSE dataset.

By the end of this project, you will be able to:
• Calculate summary statistics using spreadsheets.
• Create data visualizations using spreadsheets.
• Ask questions and answer them using data.
• Work with real-world data that has missing and incorrect values.
• Calculate key business metrics in financial analysis and interpret
 values.
• Forecast financial metrics using scenario analysis


# Project 3 - Query Digital Music Store Database

In this project, you will be provided a dataset reflecting data collected from an experiment. You’ll use statistical techniques to answer questions about the data and report your conclusions and recommendations in a report.

By the end of this project, you will be able to:
• Write SQL to query a single table.
• Write SQL to query multiple tables.
• Ask a question that requires data from multiple places, join the
 data together, and answer the question.
• Install SQL on your own machine, upload a database, ask
 complex questions about the data in a database, and query the
 database to answer those questions.


# Project 4 - Buid Data Dashboards

Sharing insights is an integral part of working with data. In this project, you’ll build interactive dashboards with Tableau to tell stories from data. You’ll use a dataset of flight delays in the US to visualize the quality of airlines and airports, find the best times to fly, and more. These types of visualizations help guide decision making to reach the best outcomes.

By the end of this project, you will be able to:
 • Select the most appropriate data visualization for an analysis.
 • Evaluate the effectiveness of a data visualization.
 • Build interactive and engaging Tableau dashboards.
